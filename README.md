# Portfolio01

Hello everyone,

This project is a simple yet captivating portfolio page that I developed based on a YouTube video. This marks my first project where I coded it exactly as demonstrated in the video, enabling me to grasp the ins and outs of coding by mimicking the tutorial. I plan to continue this approach for future YouTube-based projects, coding everything from scratch without relying on the video.

For this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope you enjoy it, and if you found it enjoyable, please consider giving it a star.
